ECE1767H - Design for Test and Testability
Graduate
Prerequisites: Any senior-level VLSI design or logic design course plus intermediate level skills in programming with C or C++.
The Semiconductor Industry Association anticipates that Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) semi-conductor devices of the near future will indeed be “very large”, including designs that integrate 100-200 million transistors operating in 1-3 GHz clock rates. Due to the increasing dependence on microelectronic devices and the concern for high reliability and short time-to-market window, the VLSI Computer Aided Design community faces great challenges in the development of tools that aid the design of complex devices and guarantee their functionality.
This course covers fundamentals of testing theory and practice for complex VLSI designs and it is a good source of information for engineers with interests in chip and system level design, test engineers and CAD developers. The objective is to give students the ability to solve a wide range of non-trivial testing problems using practical and cost effective techniques. Computer-aided design tools will be developed throughout the semester from the students. These tools will serve as an application of the theory presented in class. Topics covered include Logic Simulation, Fault Modeling, Fault Simulation, Algorithms and techniques for Automatic Test Pattern Generation in Combinational and Sequential Circuits (D-algorithm, PODEM, recursive learning), Design Error/Fault Diagnosis, Introduction to Functional Testing of Microprocessors, ALUs and Memories, Design for Testability, and logic and scan Built-in Self-Test.

ECE1770H - Trends in Middleware Systems –Blockchain Technology
Graduate
The objectives of this course are to understand the characteristics of emerging blockchain abstractions, how they differ in conception and use, and how to apply blockchains to build distributed applications. We refer to these abstractions as “blockchain middleware”.
A “middleware system” — middleware for short, — constitutes services and (programming) abstractions that facilitate the development of distributed applications and systems in heterogeneous networked environments. The primary objectives of middleware are to increase application reliability, availability, fault-tolerance, scalability, and security. At least conceptually, the “middleware layer” comprises a layer below the application and above the operating system and network substrate.
This course targets research-oriented graduate students who would like to learn more about blockchain middleware. We will discuss the Bitcoin blockchain, the Ethereum blockchain, and the Hyperledger blockchain as well as explore how to build blockchain-based applications. The course will feature invited speakers and student paper presentations. A course project will be a mandatory aspect of the course.

ECE1771H - Quality of Service
Graduate
This course aims to present a collection of fundamental design principles and guidelines in modern distributed systems and real- world large-scale networks. In the process, we review a small collection of important research results, not only in the recent literature but also in the literature spanning the past two decades, and see how they reflect fundamental design principles that we have discussed. Our focus is on more recent research literature, in the areas that have been studied extensively: multimedia networking, peer- to-peer networks, as well as multi-hop wireless networks.
The holy grail of distributed systems and networking design is to achieve Quality of Service, or QoS. Quality of Service is concerned with the “peace of mind” that resources are set aside to guarantee a particular level of performance, even with competition from other users sharing the same pool of resources. We will see why this is hard, and why it sometimes may not be necessary. However, having such an objective is important to motivate innovation in the design of distributed systems and real-world networks, wireless or wired.
The course is divided into a number of episodes (each covered in the time of approximately one lecture depending on progress). We start with an examination of our design objectives, including Quality of Service. We then introduce a number of fundamental design principles that may lead to a high-quality design. Subsequently, we take a leisure walk through more specific areas of research, spanning peer- to-peer networks, wireless mesh networks, secure protocols, so-called “killer” applications, as well as recent advances in network coding. Throughout the course, we revisit the design principles often, and see how they affect the successes (or failures) of research ideas.

Along the way, concepts crucial to the study of sensory system are also introduced including: the identification and categorization of sensory stimuli, reaction time, decision-making processes, differentiation of stimuli, the limits of perceptibility, and large-scale integration of sensory information. The course will also consider applications of sensory research to pattern recognition, multimedia and biological computers.

ECE1781H - Dependable Software Systems
Graduate
Prerequisites: ECE344H1 or equivalent
Modern computer systems have become tightly intertwined with our daily lives. However, they are failure-prone and difficult to manage and thus hardly dependable. Today, these problems dominate total cost of ownership of computer systems, and unfortunately they have no simple solutions. There is a realization that these problems cannot be decisively solved but are ongoing facts of life that must be dealt with regularly. To do so, systems should be designed to detect, isolate and recover from these problems.
This advanced graduate-level course focuses on dependability in software systems and examines current research that aims to address challenges caused by software and hardware bugs and software misconfiguration.

Graduate
Prerequisites: ECE410 or ECE557H1 or equivalent.
The course explores design of control systems that achieve complex specifications.

ECE1658H - Geometric Nonlinear Control of Robotic Systems
Graduate
Required backgound: This course has no formal prerequisites, but assumes knowledge of vector calculus and linear algebra. Ideally, the student taking this course will have taken an introductory course on nonlinear control theory, such as ECE1647F, and be familiar with the Lagrangian modelling of robots from a course like ECE470.
This course presents recent developments on control of underactuated mechanical systems, focusing on the notion of virtual constraint.
Traditionally, motion control problems in robotics are partitioned in two parts: motion planning and trajectory tracking. The motion planning algorithm converts the motion specification into reference signals for the robot joints. The trajectory tracker uses feedback control to make the robot joints track the reference signals. There is an emerging consensus in the academic community that this approach is inadequate for sophisticated motion control problems, in that reference signals impose a timing on the control loop which is unnatural and inherently non robust.
The virtual constraint technique does not rely on any reference signal, and does not impose any timing in the feedback loop. Motions are characterized implicitly through constraints that are enforced via feedback. Through judicious choice of the constraints, one may induce motions that are surprisingly natural and biologically plausible. For this reason, the virtual constraints technique has become a dominant paradigm in bipedal robot locomotion, and has the potential of becoming even more widespread in other area of robot locomotion.
The virtual constraint approach is geometric in nature. This course presents the required mathematical tools from differential geometry and surveys the basic results in this emergent research area. Topics covered will include:
– Differentiable manifolds and basic operations.
