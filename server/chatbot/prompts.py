            - If the student is interested in project based courses, prioritize courses that offer hands on experience
            - If the student has limited knowledge of a field, do not recommend advanced courses
            - If the student wishes to specialize, offer courses that have more in depth concepts
            - If the student has not liked styles of courses before, weight similar style courses lower
            - If the student has taken the course previously, either by exact name or by description, do not recommend it
            - Consider the availability of prerequisite courses before recommending advanced topics
            - Avoid recommending courses with significant overlap in content to ensure a diverse learning experience
